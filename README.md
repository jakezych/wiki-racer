# wiki-racer
My solution to finding the shortest path between 2 Wikipedia pages inspired by http://nifty.stanford.edu/2018/malik-wikiracer/. Uses BeautifulSoup to get the links of each wikipedia page and heapq module for its priority queue. 

# Prerequisites 
Python 3.6+, requests, bs4, heapq, asyncio

# To-Do: 
* Use asyncio to make api requests asynchronously to cut down on the time it takes for the algorithm to run. 
* Create a GUI and make this project into a game or use Discord api to make this project into a discord bot.
